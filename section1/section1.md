### What is a Data Strucutre?
- a way of organizing data on your computer
- easier to find data if data is stored understandibly

### Why?
- it is important to have data structures to make software run efficiently

### What is an algorithm?
- a set of steps to complete a task
**What makes a good algorithm?**
- efficiency and correctness
**Why do we care**
- efficient algorithms create faster software w/o memory leaks
**What are the types of data structures?**
- Primitive - data structures that cannot be broken down into smaller data structures
    - fixed size
    - simple operations
    - examples
        - integers
        - floats
        - Strings
        - booleans
- Non Primitive - can be broken down into smaller data structures
    - more flexible
    - complex operations
    - Linear
        - elements arranged in sequential order 
    - non linear
        - elements arranged in sequential order
        - order does not matter
            - array
            - stack
        - hierarchal structure
            - tree
            - graphs
            - objects/classes

### What are the types of algorithms
sorting - store in data in ascending/descending order
    - insert
    - selection
Search - find a specific value in a data set
Graph - work with data that can be represent as a graph
dynamic programming - solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems
Divide and conquer - similar to dyanima, divide problem into smaller problems, work from there
